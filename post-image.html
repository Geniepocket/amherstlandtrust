                                <span>Addie grew up in the San Francisco Bay area and yes, she is the one with the "49ers" license plate. After marrying her husband William, and having two boys, in 1986 she moved to Amherst where she quickly got involved in town activities. Addie served on the Souhegan Cooperative School Board for 14 years. She also served as Chair of the Amherst Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Committee; was a member of the Amherst Recreation Commission; was a member of the Souhegan Scholarship Foundation; and was an Amherst Democratic Committee Board member for years. Through her various involvements, Addie has seen the value of moderating growth and preserving open space as both a way of honoring our environment and allowing the direction of tax monies to maintaining existing infrastructure instead of expanding (and then having to maintain) new projects.

(Tom is a descendent of several of the founding families of Amherst.) They maintain a small homestead on Green Road and run the family business, a sawmill started by Edward Hartshorn in 1808.<br><br>
                                      Sally is a graduate of Boston College. She is the author of a number of books including Sports and Games in Medieval Cultures from Greenwood Press, several titles in Capstone's Bridgestone Science Library for young readers, and The Insider's Guide to New Hampshire (co-authored with Nancy Elcock of Wilton).<br><br>
                                      Tom's grandfather, Harold Hartshorn Wilkins, Jr., was one of the charter members of the Amherst Land Trust, a man with a life-long commitment to land preservation. Tom and Sally have tried to carry on that legacy both in the way they run their business and in their community activities. This has included such diverse threads as running a 4H group, giving farm and mill tours to school groups, canvassing for signatures and writing heated letters to the newspapers! Sally and Tom donated a piece of Harold's land to the Amherst Land Trust when he died in 2003. They recently placed more than 500 acres of land in Amherst and Mont Vernon under permanent easement with the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests.
